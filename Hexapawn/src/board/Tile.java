public class Tile {
	
	/* 
	 * This class will define what properties a tile has.
	 * Tiles are the single areas of the board a piece can move to.
	 * 
	 * A tile will be signed an X and Y Coordinate to define it's location. Since the board consists of a 3x3 grid of tiles, the coordinates
	 * are as follows.
	 * 
	 * (1,3)	(2,3)	(3,3)
	 * (1,2)	(2,2)	(3,2)
	 * (1,1)	(2,1)	(3,1)
	 * 
	 * A tile can be empty, which means other pieces can move to it's location (but not use the take action).
	 * 
	 * A tile can be occupied, which makes it impossible for any other piece to move to it's location. However a piece can use the take action
	 * to move to a tile occupied by an opponents piece and remove that piece from the game.
